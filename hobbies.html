            <p>I am very into the NFT space, especially from a design persepective. I am currently working with a group
                of Michigan students on an NFT collection project that makes michigan themed NFTs. Each sale will have a 
                special prize for the buyer. We are planning on dropping the collection in February!

    <p>I am currently a part time DJ that does events bars, weddings, and other social events. I began DJing this past year
        and I have been enthralled ever since. My first introduction to music was in elementary school when I started
        playing the saxaphone and did so up until senior year of high school. Listen to one of the songs I created below!<p>
