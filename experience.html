<p>During first semester this year I worked at Plug and Play Tech Center as an investment analyst intern. I evaluated pitch decks and CIMS for 200+ North American, European, and Asian biotechnology, smart- technology, and financial-technology startups seeking $500k-$10m investment.
I assessed company technology, total addressable market, and competitive advantage for the global VC firm. I also engaged in bi-weekly calls with investment professionals to discuss companies in various sectors, from enterprise
software to consumer tech products, resulting in 10 funded equity investments.</p>

<p>I recently began working for a seed-stage tech startup based in Austin Texas called Beacon. This is a fintech company
    that helps small business owners sell their buesinesses and also serves as a useful platform for people looking
    to invest in a small business. Thus far I have worked as a tech consultant helping build out the marketing end
    of the startup.
